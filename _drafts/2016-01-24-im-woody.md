I'm not Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, and I'm OK with that.

Watched **Toy Story** again. Caught something I didn't ever notice before.

I *literally* can't believe I never remembered seeing that. Maybe I just don't pay close enough attention to children's movies.

They do have a lot of great things snuck in for adults watching. There are a lot of jokes that just go over the kids heads. For the record, **this isn't one of them**.
