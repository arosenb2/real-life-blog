        <h4>Welcome to Real Life with the A'baums!</h4>
        <p>We hope that you will be encouraged (or at least amused...) as we try to keep it real around here. We "A'baums" are a party of four living down yonder (ahem, the South...) who are just trying to live our lives for Jesus. We hope that you can see Him here and that you find Him in the midst of your own "real life."</p>

        <p>What’s that burden you’re carrying? Is it a private one? One that you feel like the whole world knows?</p>

<p>What’s that prayer that you whisper constantly through the day? The one you’ve woken up and prayed for countless times. Over and over.</p>

<p>What’s that thing that wearing you down? That relationship? That schedule? Those bills?</p>

<p>That thing that’s been on your mind since you saw that headline come across your newsfeed. That hope in your heart since you saw those test results. That fear that you’ve tried to squelch ever since that scary night in the ER.</p>

<p>I don’t have any easy fixes or 10 ways to make it better. We surely don’t have it all together over here. BUT, Jesus does say the same thing to you and to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<strong>Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.</strong> Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. <strong>For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.</strong>” <cite>Matthew 11:28-30 (NIV, emphasis added)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever that prayer, whatever that burden, give it over to Him. Daily. Hourly if needed.</p>

<p>And in Him, find rest.</p>
