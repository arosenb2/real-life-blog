    <title>Real Life With the A&#39;baums</title>
    <description>We hope that you will be encouraged (or at least amused...) as we try to keep it real around here. We &quot;A&#39;baums&quot; are a party of four living down yonder (ahem, the South...) who are just trying to live our lives for Jesus. We hope that you can see Him here and that you find Him in the midst of your own &quot;real life.&quot;</description>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>Work life balance isn’t always the easiest thing to achieve. You want to do everything you can to provide for the people you love.</p>

<p>With a second child now, my time is split even more than it was before. Balancing between work and family only gets harder as time goes on.</p>

<p>I am very blessed to work in the technology industry. Technology jobs are leading the path for fathers to be able to more easily balance their time, whether it is from working from home or having flexible work hours. At my previous job, I had the option to work from home full time, and I cherish all of the moments I spent with Asher during his first year. Of course, working from home didn’t mean that I spent all day every day with my family - it meant that I didn’t have a commute in the morning and evening and that I could spend time getting snuggles during work breaks instead of hanging out at the water cooler.</p>

<p>I can occasionally work from home these days, but it is usually limited to when we have a doctor’s appointment. That’s alright though - it is much harder to work from home with two kids than it was with one baby. I am able to take advantage of flexible hours at work though. This lets me spend every morning playing with Asher and every evening playing with Addy.</p>

<p>It’s such a fun routine and it brings me so much joy in the morning to hear Asher calling out “oh daddy, where are you?”, knowing that he is genuinely excited to get up and play with me.</p>

<p>This phase won’t last forever and we’ll find new ways to spend time together, but as for now, I wouldn’t trade my 7-9am for anything (except for some extra sleep occasionally - after all, I am a parent of a 4 month old as well.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, you just need to find the extra margin and appreciate the precious moments you get. They are far beyond worth it, especially since you never get them back.</p>

        <title>let me Google that for you</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Real life is… when you Google “toddler tantrums” but you’re not seeing anything that you haven’t already tried. (Ignoring it, not ignoring it, trying to figure out if he is still tired or hungry or probably all of it or maybe none of it, and  “hey, do you want to go watch Thomas?”)</p>

<p>So you take a deep breath and pray. And in your head you know you’re not the only mama dealing with this right now, but it kind of feels that way.</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks Lysa TerKeurst for the reminder that, “bad moments don’t make bad mamas.” And thank you, Jesus, for patience (and for Thomas the train.)</p>

        <title>baby toots</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Asher called Addy a “toodeler”.</p>

<p>To be fair, Addy does have a lot of gas. And it <strong>smells. so. bad.</strong></p>

<p>But he really is very sweet to her and likes snuggling up to her.</p>

<p>It’s some good <em>#siblinglove</em>.</p>

        <title>Real Life</title>
        <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, y’all! Welcome to <em>real life with the a’baums</em>! Here, we’re just trying to keep it real. And as you know, sometimes <em>real life</em> gets sticky… with baby drool and spilled milk and words that would have been better left unsaid. But sometimes, <em>real life</em> is really sweet… like morning snuggles and silly giggles and his hand holding yours as you whisper nighttime prayers.</p>

<p>But you probably already know that, right? Because you’re living your own <em>real life</em>, too. Real life with your own real schedules and real responsibilities. Real life with your own messes to tidy, checks to sign, and mouths to feed. Real life with your own struggles and heartaches and loads to bear. Real life with real moments that, on many days, just fly by altogether too quickly.</p>

<p>In that, we have something in common. Though on the outside our lives might seem quite different, we really are more alike than you think. We’re all just trying to live <em>real life</em>, and hope to make it count for something.</p>

<p>So regardless of where you are on your <em>real life</em> journey, we hope you stop by again soon. Together maybe we’ll find that real life, in fact, is really quite beautiful.</p>

<p>Keepin’ it real and stuff,</p>

<p>Alyssa</p>
