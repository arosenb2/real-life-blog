As a toddler, Asher says many things that are very unique. Being around him, we've come up a little mini translation guide for speaking in *Asher*. Some of his words are clear, while others are more of a stretch.

This is the first of many, and I hope you enjoy every single one.

|English|Asherism|Example|
|-------|--------|-------|
|Tooter|Toodeler|(*points to Addy*) Toodeler!|
|Walk|Run|**Me**: Do you want to go for a walk? **Asher**: Run?|
|Like|Wike|I wike it!|
|Please|Pease|Thomas? Watch? I want. Pease.|
|Yogurt|Gurt|Gurt? I want. Pease.|
|Mayonnaise|Gurt|(*points to toy mayo bottle*) Gurt!|
|Addy|Maddy|Maddy! Where are you?|
|Numbers (13-19)|Wonteen|Eleven, twelve, wonteen, wonteen, twenty!|
