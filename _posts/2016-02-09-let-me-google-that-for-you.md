Real life is... when you Google "toddler tantrums" but you're not seeing anything that you haven't already tried. (Ignoring it, not ignoring it, trying to figure out if he is still tired or hungry or probably all of it or maybe none of it, and  "hey, do you want to go watch Thomas?")

So you take a deep breath and pray. And in your head you know you're not the only mama dealing with this right now, but it kind of feels that way.

Anyways, thanks Lysa TerKeurst for the reminder that, "bad moments don't make bad mamas." And thank you, Jesus, for patience (and for Thomas the train.)
